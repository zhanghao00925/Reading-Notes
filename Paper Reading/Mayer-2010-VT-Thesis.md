The tiling of the virtual texture into equally sized tiles is crucial to the virtual texturing system: in principle the virtual texture system has to determine the needed “parts”
of the virtual texture and provide them to the virtual texturing shader. This is (only)
efficiently possible since the “parts” are precomputed equally sized tiles.
